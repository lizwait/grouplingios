## iOS Groupling app

Groupling is an iOS application that is used to coordinate group trips. Organizing activities and keeping track of itineraries for a number of people can get a bit tedious. Having a webapp dedicated to this specific need will make this more streamlined and accessible. Groupling will have the ability to set up a group stay with reservation info, travel itineraries, local social spots, group outings, etc.
